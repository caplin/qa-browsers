    screen bounds


SmartGit/Hg 4.6.2 (2013-08-07)
==============================
New Features, Improvements

- Git:
    - Blame: "Changes Since"-highlighting is derived from "read-only"
      background color to be compatible with dark schemes
    - Fetch More: offers "changes/" refs to allow checking out individual
      changes from Gerrit 
    - Git-Flow Finish Hotfix: merging to develop became optional

======================================
New Features, Improvements
--------------------------
- Git:
  - warn before modifying already pushed commits
  - Log: group commits of distinct development lines together (instead of
    strictly sorting by date)
  - Push: even when using force, check whether the remote repository still
    points to same commit as the remote branch
- Git-flow:
  - support for .gitflow configuration file (in working tree) helping to
    initialize git-flow after a clone
  - if a branch is behind its tracked branch, the user is asked whether to
    perform the fast-forward merge or abort the command
  - warn when trying to commit directly to master
- "Pushable Commits"
  - renamed to "Outgoing"

  - context-specific toolbar button: defaulted to configure though already
    configured (but no branch checked out)
- Hg:
  - .hg/locks could remain when exiting while commands were running
- Branches:
  - Git-flow-categories: if creating a new feature (, hotfix, ...) the
    category was not expanded correctly
- GUI:
  - mouse hover tooltip over truncated table cells also was too narrow
  - OS X: the first row of the Log visually "jumped"

Fixed Bugs
----------
- Git
  - Branches: Set Tracking did not work for selected local and remote branch
  - Switching to origin/foo/bar branch suggested wrong local branch name (bar
    instead of foo/bar)
